# 0x09. Python - Everything is object
    The first part is only questions about Python’s specificity like “What would be the result of…”

## Learning Objectives
    At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

* What is a reference
* What is an assignment
